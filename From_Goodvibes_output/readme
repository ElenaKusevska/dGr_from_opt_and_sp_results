c++ is a better option than python for this one

------------------------------------------------------
Program to calculate the free energies of reactions. 
------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The computed geometries should be in a directory tree of the form:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

        level_of_theory_1       level_of_theory_2      level_of_theory_3 ...
          1    2    3 ...         1   2   3 ...              ...
  1_1 1b 11a  2_1 2b  ...            ...                     ...
         (some random names 
         for the different 
         located structures here)

-------------------------------------------
The input file should have the structure:
-------------------------------------------

Levels of theory: level_of_theory_1 level_of_theory_2 
         // names of directories with the higher and lower levels of theory
         // will read only the first two. Because... it makes no sense to
         // put more than two here
         // if there are more than two give error

Reactions:

R1 r 1 2 p 3 4
    // read reaction name, r, read labels of reactants, if labels='p'
    // read labels of products

R2 r 3 4 IrIII p 5 6 IrIV

For reading: when reach end of file quit. Close file.

If more isomers - sort energies - find lowest energy isomer

Read cpu time. Convert from days/hours/minutes/seconds to just seconds.

-------------------------------------
The program does the following:
-------------------------------------

goes in dir 1 2 3 4...
if there are other directories, changes labels array to those directory names
then gets their energies. Otherwise. Just gets energy (for example something like goutput).

If there are more isomers (subdirectories in main directory for particular intermediate)
find lowest one

Calculate free energies of reaction

----------------------------
Output - reaction energies:
----------------------------

E1:

1 + 2 ---> 3 + 4
dG = 2.3 kcal/mol

E2:

3 + 4 + IrIII ---> 5 + 6 + IrIV
dG = 4.5 kcal/mol

Also. Output lowest energy isomers in separate file.

Also. Output all isomers in order of increasing energy, if there were more
than one for each structure

Also. Print SI info with lowest E geometries and energies. have an option to just do that.
